# Programming in Science - Lab 1

This template repository is the starter project for Programming in Science Lab 1. Written in Python, and tested with Pytest.

### Question(s)

1. A ball is dropped from a height  h_0  (in meters), and after a given time  t  (in seconds), the height  h(t)  of the ball is given by the formula:

![](Q1.png)

Where:
- h(t)  is the height of the ball at time  t  (in meters).  
- h_0  is the initial height from which the ball is dropped (in meters).  
- g  is the acceleration due to gravity, which is approximately  9.8 \, m/s^2 .  
- t  is the time elapsed since the ball was dropped (in seconds).  

Tasks:  

1.	Define an algorithm that describes the steps to calculate the height of the ball at time  t  using the given formula.  
2.	Write a Python function that calculates the height of the ball at time  t  after being dropped from an initial height  h_0 .  
3.	Perform arithmetic operations to calculate the height of the ball at a given time.  
4.	Test your function by calculating the height of a ball dropped from a height of 50 meters at 3 different time intervals (e.g., at 1 second, 2 seconds, and 3 seconds).  
5.	Apply basic debugging techniques to check that your code works for different inputs and edge cases (e.g., when  t = 0 ).  

Example Output for calculate_height() Function:  

When running the program for calculate_height(), here’s how the interaction should look:  
```
Enter initial height: 50
Enter time: 1
Height of the ball at time 1 second = 44.1 meters

Enter initial height: 50
Enter time: 2
Height of the ball at time 2 seconds = 29.2 meters

Enter initial height: 50
Enter time: 3
Height of the ball at time 3 seconds = 13.3 meters
```

2. A car travels at a constant speed of 20 meters per second. Calculate the distance the car will travel in a given time t (in seconds). Use the formula:  

![](Q2.png)  

where:  
- Speed = 20 meters/second  
- Time = given as input in seconds.  

When running the program for calculate_car_distance(), the interaction should look as follows:  

```
Enter time for car (in seconds): 1
The car will travel 20 meters in 1 second.

Enter time for car (in seconds): 2
The car will travel 40 meters in 2 seconds.

Enter time for car (in seconds): 3
The car will travel 60 meters in 3 seconds.
```
